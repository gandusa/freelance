# 🛠️ Freelance Smart Contract

A decentralized freelance contract written in **Clarity** for the **Stacks blockchain**. This smart contract ensures trustless agreements between freelancers and clients by using an **escrow system**, **milestone-based payments**, and **dispute resolution**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Escrow System**: Funds are locked in escrow until task completion.
- **Milestone Payments**: Clients can approve and release payments in stages.
- **Dispute Resolution**: A fair system to handle conflicts between parties.
- **Multi-Signature Approvals**: Added security for fund releases.
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient contract execution for reduced transaction costs.

## 🏗️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Stacks CLI](https://docs.hiro.so/get-started/installing) installed  
- Clarity development environment (`clarinet`)  

### Steps to Deploy
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freelance-smart-contract.git
   cd freelance-smart-contract
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   clarinet check
   ```
3. Deploy the contract on a local testnet:
   ```sh
   clarinet deploy
   ```

## 📝 Usage

### Client Actions:
- **Create a Contract**: Deposit funds into escrow.
- **Approve Milestone**: Release payment for completed work.
- **Resolve Dispute**: Engage dispute resolution if needed.

### Freelancer Actions:
- **Accept Contract**: Agree to terms and start work.

## 🔐 Security & Considerations

- All transactions are **transparent** and **verifiable** on the blockchain.
- Funds are **protected in escrow** until work is approved.
- Smart contract **reduces fraud risk** for both parties.
